  <h3><b>Personal Info</b></h3>
  <h4> Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
    proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
    you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
    involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
    didn’t hold with such nonsense</h4>
  <br>
  <h4>Well as you can probably see from above I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I read fanfics all the time. If I see a buzzfeed quiz about Harry Potter I HAVE to get a full score in that. </h4>
  <h4>Coming back to the real world. I am a second year software engineering student at Dwarkadas Jivanlal Sanghvi College of Engineering. I did my schooling from Ryan International School ICSE Malad from 2007 to 2017 and went to Sathaye Junior College in Vile Parle East in the years 2017-2019. I like programming, its like magic (another HP reference) for me. Type in a few keys and voila! something amazing happens. My favourite programming language is Python. Mainly because its the first language I programmed in and it has never failed me. Has awesome modules, easy to code and is powerful. Well the same reasons Guido van Rossum created that language in 1991.</h4>
  <br>
  <h4>My Hobbies consist of reading (Mostly Fanfiction LOL). I also like swimming, cycling and driving. I enjoy the quiteness and prefer to sit alone and read a book or go for lone walks. Basically this means I am kinda an introvert. Driving is one of the few things i like very much. I also love cars, not from a mechanical point of view but from a driver's point of view. I always keep myself updated with the latest cars and car tech and am often found scrolling through teambhp.com . </h4>
